Social Network

This is one of the my projects where I made a Social network.
When you enter the page for the first time a login form will appear. You can click on Register to create an account.

When you log in or register, you get redirected to the main page.
There, you can see, on the left side your profile (Change profile and Login off) and on the right side comments section.

You can change your email or username and you can delete your profile.
You can comment and delete your comments.
You can like and comment other users comments.

I created a cookie to stop redirecting to the main page without logging or registering.

This project is built with: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and mockAPi.

** The main goal was functionality, not design **
